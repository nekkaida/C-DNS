## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-10

### Added
- DNS header structure implementation compliant with RFC 1035
- Response generation with proper header field values:
  - Query ID (1234)
  - Query/Response bit set to 1 (response)
  - All flag fields set to expected test values
- Network/host byte order conversion functions for DNS headers
- Debug logging for received queries and sent responses

### Changed
- Replaced simple echo response with structured DNS response packet
- Updated packet handling to parse and process DNS-specific data
- Modified buffer handling to work with binary DNS message format

### Technical Notes
- This implementation focuses only on the header section (12 bytes)
- Future work will add support for question, answer, authority, and additional sections
- The server currently uses hardcoded values required by the test suite rather than dynamically responding to query content

Implement DNS answer section with A record response
Changes:
Add answer section to DNS response with A record
Set answer count (ancount) to 1 in header
Include complete answer record structure:
Domain name (codecrafters.io)
Type (A record)
Class (IN)
TTL (60 seconds)
IPv4 address (8.8.8.8)
Calculate and manage proper section offsets
Ensure network byte order for all multi-byte fields
Technical Details:
Answer section follows RFC 1035 format
Uses proper memory layout with memcpy operations
Maintains correct byte ordering with htons/htonl
Total response includes header + question + answer sections
Testing:
Verified response format matches DNS protocol specification
Confirmed proper byte alignment of all fields
Tested with DNS query for codecrafters.io
