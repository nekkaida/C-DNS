## [0.2.0] - 2025-04-10

### Added
- DNS header structure implementation compliant with RFC 1035
- Response generation with proper header field values:
  - Query ID (1234)
  - Query/Response bit set to 1 (response)
  - All flag fields set to expected test values
- Network/host byte order conversion functions for DNS headers
- Debug logging for received queries and sent responses

### Changed
- Replaced simple echo response with structured DNS response packet
- Updated packet handling to parse and process DNS-specific data
- Modified buffer handling to work with binary DNS message format

### Technical Notes
- This implementation focuses only on the header section (12 bytes)
- Future work will add support for question, answer, authority, and additional sections
- The server currently uses hardcoded values required by the test suite rather than dynamically responding to query content

Implement DNS answer section with A record response
Changes:
Add answer section to DNS response with A record
Set answer count (ancount) to 1 in header
Include complete answer record structure:
Domain name (codecrafters.io)
Type (A record)
Class (IN)
TTL (60 seconds)
IPv4 address (8.8.8.8)
Calculate and manage proper section offsets
Ensure network byte order for all multi-byte fields
Technical Details:
Answer section follows RFC 1035 format
Uses proper memory layout with memcpy operations
Maintains correct byte ordering with htons/htonl
Total response includes header + question + answer sections
Testing:
Verified response format matches DNS protocol specification
Confirmed proper byte alignment of all fields
Tested with DNS query for codecrafters.io


Add full DNS response capability with header, question and answer sections:

* Core Functionality:
  - Parse incoming DNS query headers
  - Copy query ID and flags to response
  - Add answer section with A record support
  - Return IP 8.8.8.8 for codecrafters.io

* Technical Implementation:
  - Add DNS header structure per RFC 1035
  - Handle network byte order conversion
  - Implement proper section alignment
  - Manage memory layout with offset tracking
  - Set TTL to 60 seconds for responses

* Improvements:
  - Add error handling for malformed packets
  - Include detailed debug logging
  - Ensure proper byte alignment
  - Handle OPCODE validation

This implementation completes stage 4 of the DNS server challenge,
providing a working DNS responder for A record queries.
